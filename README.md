# Britannia RNN Model

Welcome to the Britannia RNN Model repository! This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to analyze and predict [specific task, e.g., sales trends, time-series data] for Britannia products. The model leverages RNN architectures to understand patterns in sequential data and generate forecasts or insights.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate an RNN model to address [specific problem, e.g., sales forecasting, demand prediction] using historical data from Britannia. The approach involves data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and preparation for RNN modeling.
- **RNN Model**: Implements an RNN model using [framework, e.g., TensorFlow/Keras] for sequential data analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides performance metrics and evaluation techniques to assess model effectiveness.
- **Prediction**: Generates forecasts or predictions based on the RNN model's outputs.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains [describe the data, e.g., historical sales data, product information]. You can find the dataset in the `data/` directory or refer to [dataset source] if it's external.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Britannia RNN Model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SakshiFadnavis2003/Britannia-RNN-Model.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Britannia-RNN-Model
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open `Britannia_RNN_Model.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any compatible IDE.

5. **Train the Model**:
   Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the RNN model, and evaluate its performance.

## Usage

After training the model, you can use it to generate predictions or analyze new sequential data. Update the `predict` function in the notebook with your own data to get results.
